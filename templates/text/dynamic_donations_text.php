            <p><!-- Pastoral Council -->
					Pastoral Council
					St Joseph's Parish Pastoral Council was set up in May
					2005. Eleven representatives were elected by the people of the parish
					to work on their behalf with the parish team.
					The responsibilities of pastoral council members include: growing in
					knowledge and awareness of what is happening in the parish; listening
					to, and getting to know the needs and views of, other parishioners;
					assisting with implementation of parish policies. <br>
					Following its establishment, the Pastoral Council adopted this mission
					statement: <br>
					<br>
					<i>We, the parishioners of St Joseph's Parish, East Wall - North
					Strand, believing in and inspired by Jesus Christ, are a caring
					community who together strive to commit ourselves to worship, mission
                    and evangelisation. For the coming years we are committed to making our
					parish a place where each person feels welcome, accepted and
                    valued.</i></p>
			<p><!-- Baptismal Ministry -->
					Baptismal Ministry
					A group of people were approached to form a baptismal
					team. We undertook training in Clonliffe College.The team has grown
					over the years; we are now ten in number. In the past we visited
					parents in their homes to help them prepare for the baptism of their
					child. Recently, this has changed. Parents and godparents now meet with
					members of the baptismal team in the meeting room in the Church
					Sacristy .These meetings take place on the wednesday night before the
					2nd Sunday of the month at 7.30pm. Parents who wish to have their child
					baptised should give a month's notice, so that arrangements can be made
					for pre-baptism preparation.</p>
			<p><!-- Bethany Bereavement Support Group -->
					Bethany Bereavement Support Group
					The Bethany Bereavement Support Group aims to help
					those in our parish who are bereaved or grieving. At present there are
					6 members in this group and we meet once a month. Last year, it was
					decided that a Month's Mind Mass would be held every month for those
                    who died in the parish in the previous month. At this Mass we also pray
					for the bereaved. <br>
                    A recent development in bereavement support is the monthly Parish
					Month's Mind Mass. The Saturday evening parish mass is celebrated for
					parishioners who have died in the previous month. This Mass is
					organized by the Bethany Group, who visit the bereaved families prior
					to the mass and are available to meet them at the monthly mass. Every
					November, we organize an Annual Mass for parishioners who have died
					during the previous year. The Bethany group is there to meet the
					bereaved families. <br>
					We are in the process of developing a bereavement support strategy
					which will consist of one-to-one meetings and/or group support.</p>
			<p><!-- Scripture Exploration Group -->

					Wednesday evening the members meet and share views on the Scripture
					reading for the coming Sunday. </p>
			<p><!-- Ministers of the Eucharist -->
					Ministers of the Eucharist
					This Ministry was established approximately 20 years
					ago. At present, 17 people are commissioned as Ministers of the
					Eucharist and we are in the process of commissioning new ministers. The
					role of a minister of the Eucharist is to distribute Holy Communion at
					Mass and to bring Holy Communion to housebound parishioners on Sundays
					and First Fridays.</p>
			<p><!-- The Ministers of the Word -->
					The Ministers of the Word
					With the introduction of the new liturgy of the Mass
					following the Second Vatican Council, active participation in the Mass
					was encouraged by the Church. As a result, all lay people were
					designated Ministers of the Word. Beginning in 1976, the Word began to
					be proclaimed by lay people in our parish. Today we have 25 formally
					commissioned Ministers of the Word. These ministers participate in the
					Liturgy of the Word at every Mass.</p>
			<p><!-- The Choir -->
					The Choir
					The present church choir has been together for about
					15years, under the guidance of our organist May Grace. We participate
					in the 11.30am Mass on Sundays throughout the year and at Masses on
					special occasions. We have participated in several live RTÃ‰ radio
					broadcasts of Mass from St Joseph's Church. <br>
                    We have also joined with the choir of St Agatha's parish, North William
					Street, on special occasions in both Parish churches. Our most recent
					joint endeavour was our participation in the special 50th Anniversary
					Mass for the Sick on 30th July <br>
					At present we have a total membership of 13. We would welcome new
					members, both Male and Female, with open arms. If you would like to
					join us please contact either May Grace or Patricia Russell after the
					11.30am Sunday Mass.</p>
			<p><!-- RCIA -->
					RCIA
					This is one of the more recent groups. It started in
					2005 when members of the Legion of Mary approached Fr. Peter Reilly PP
					with the request to have a person instruction and prepared for
					Baptism.Over the years other people have instructed and Baptised. The
					four members of the group, including Fr. Peter, have remained the same
					since the start. Each week the group meet our Candidate(s) at a
					convenient time. For the period of an hour share and discuss our faith.
					Candidates share their faith experiences and together they reach the
					Ceremony of Initiation.</p>
			<p><!-- Church Decoration Group -->
					Church Decoration Group
					Church decoration and liturgical Art group was set up
					a year ago. There members of the group participated in a six week
					course on flower arranging and making liturgical banners. Now we
					arrange the flowers, water and tend to the indoor plants, repair the
					alter linen and make new alter cloths and linen when required. Members
					wash and launder the alter linen regularly. We are presently making-up
					new banners for the different seasons and liturgical celebrations. Our
					aim is to keep our church bright and inspiring to so that people are
					encouraged to visit and worship in our church. As a group we are
					encouraged to visit other churches and learn what other parishes do.</p>

					representatives from various Ministry Groups involved in Liturgy.</p>
			<p><!-- St. Vincent de Paul Society -->
					St. Vincent de Paul Society
					The conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul
					started in the parish in 1917. The conference name was St.Columbanus
					and it was aggregated (registered) with the head office in Paris in
					1918. Kieran Dunne our longest serving member served with that
					conference and he joined the new conference, named after the parish in
					1999. We currently have 6 members and meet on Monday night at 7
					o'clock, in the meeting room in the sacristy. Michael McGowan the
					current president joined the Society when the new conference started in
					1999. His able helpers are Mary Maginn, Tom Daly, Mary Keeney, John
					Caufield and not forgetting Kieran Dunne who has the Society and the
					parish for almost 30 years. While the problems of poverty, way back in
					1917 no longer exist. Today's Celtic Tiger require the intervention of
					the Society to help the old, the sick and the marginalized to cope in
					an ever-changing Ireland.</p>
			<p><!-- Church Collections -->
					Church Collections
					There are three different parish collections that take
					place.
					The first is for the upkeep of the parish clergy. This collection
					includes the first collection at Masses on Saturday Evenings /
					Sundays, Christmas and Easter Dues, and Offerings made at Baptisms,
					Marriages and Funerals.
					The second collection is the Share collection for the
					developments needs of the diocese. This collection is sometimes
					replaced for collections for others needs.
					The third collection is the Family Offering Collection
					<i>(Envelope Collection)</i> for the day to day running expenses of
					the parish.</p>
			<p><!-- Finance Committee -->
					Finance Committee
					As part of the renewal and reforms in the Church
					following the Second Vatican Council, there should be a Finance
					Committee in every parish. <br>
					<br>
					<i>In each parish there is to be a finance committee to help the parish
					priest in the administration of the goods of the parish, without
					prejudice to canon 532 (Code of Cannon Law). <br>
					<br>
					It is ruled by the universal law and by the norms laid down by the
					diocesan Bishop, and sit is comprised of members of the faithful
					selected according to these norms (Canon 537)</i>
