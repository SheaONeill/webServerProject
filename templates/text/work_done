created a general message page for all errors or messages and passed values to display
added isset() function to check if the variable existed and was passed otherwise skip

added contactFormAction to front controller for contact page form processing
replaced the underscore from values passed from form with space and capitalise each word
for displaying details after form submission:

eg. ucwords(str_replace('_',' ',$who_to_contact))

parish_priest now is set to: Parish Priest


if non required form values are empty do not pass message

eg if subscribed to newsletter is true then set the variable value
otherwise skip and dont pass to message.php output:

eg. if (!empty($messageDetails_04)) {
    $messageDetails_04 = 'Newsletter Subscription: ' . $newsletter;
}
